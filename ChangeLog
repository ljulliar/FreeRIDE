	plugins/rubyide_tools_fox_project_explorer/prop_view_helpers.rb,
	plugins/rubyide_tools_fox_script_runner/script_runner.rb,
	freebase/lib/freebase/readers.rb:
	Fixed the problem of the terminal not coming up under Windows,
	however it currently causes an onPipeExcept which I haven't been
	able to track down.  In the process of fixing this bug I moved a
	large part of the initialize code to a new method in order to
	improve readability.  Added a step in the loading of a project
	where all listed files are checked, files that no longer exist are
	removed from the properties list.  Made sure that the
	project-plugin is loaded before the rubyide_tools_debugger plugin
	Fixed a bug on Windows when creating a new directory.  On Windows
	systems without a Userprofile the default userdirectory is now set
	to be "C:\My Documents\.freeride\"

	modification-times.

	* plugins/rubyide_fox_gui/editpane_configurator.rb:

2005-09-16 10:00  ljulliar

	* plugins/rubyide_fox_gui/appframe.rb : patch by Roy Sutton until
	FreeRIDE works with FOX 1.4.x. Doing it here is enough as appframe

	plugins/rubyide_tools_fox_source_browser/plugin.yaml : reverting
	to the ripper based Ruby parser. Seems to be working fine after

	* plugins/rubyide_tools_fox_irb/fox_irb.rb,
	plugins/rubyide_tools_fox_irb/fxirb.rb : upgrading to fxirb 0.2.0
	and creating an exit block but it doesn't work for now.

	* plugins/rubyide_tools_fox_source_browser/source_browser.rb :
	align the ripper based source browser with the code of the simple
	browser. Also change the update method calls to update_tree to
	make it work.

2005-03-30 16:07  ljulliar

	* plugins/rubyide_tools_fox_ri/fox_ri.rb : at startup show help
	message in the ruby documentation plugin instead of doing a lookup
	which makes the help message disappear before you have a chance to
	read it.

2005-03-29 23:50  ljulliar

	* plugins/rubyide_tools_debugger/debugger.rb : better handling of
	caught exception, clean up error line marker and debug line when
	resuming program execution.

	plugins/rubyide_gui/editpane.rb,
	plugins/rubyide_fox_gui/fxscintilla/scintilla.rb,plugins/rubyide_fox_gui/editpane.rb:
	Ruby doc now uses F1 instead of CTRL-SPACE because CTRL-SPACE
	cannot be handled properly by the key manager. F1 is also detected
	from FreeRIDE itself and not from the scintilla event
	detector. this is much more consistent with all other plugins
	behavior. Also the logic of looking up the keywords in Ruby Doc is
	now in the RI plugin and not in the editor plugin which is more
	logical.

2005-03-12 00:03  ljulliar

	* plugins/rubyide_fox_gui/editpane.rb : place the cursor in the

	* plugins/rubyide_tools_fox_source_browser/basic_source_browser.rb
	: stop the source browser plugin to wait for the on-going brwoser
	refresh to finish before halting. Otherwise it may cause FR to
	core dump while exiting.

	F9 to start Ruby Doc and put the docpkane to the front whenever
	the user looks for something.

2005-03-01 06:55  ljulliar

	* plugins/rubyide_fox_gui/dockpane.rb : in show the index of the

	style will have its font configurable.

2004-09-13 16:50  ljulliar

	* freebase/lib/freebase/properties.rb : added an auto_save

        independent from the place it is installed and run. There is now
        an internal variable which says where FR is installed. This
        codebase directory is either determined from the path to the
        freeride.rb script or can also be forced through the command line
        option --codebase or -b. The codebase directory is available in
        the global variable $FR_CODEBASE or in the
        /system/properties/config/codebase slot. One of the reason for
        this change is that FR makes no assumption about the working
        directory. The working directory remains the directry where the
        user is when freeride is started. The script runner and debugger
        have also been modified to use the script directory as the working
        directory and the debugger no longer imposes its own -I options to
        minimize interferences with the debugged process.

        * ChangeLog: file updated before final tagging of 0.5.0 gold
        
2003-04-26 07:59  curthibbs

        * plugins/rubyide_commands/core_commands.rb: On startup, FreeRIDE
        tries to reopen all files that were previously open at loast
        shutdown, but the code that did this was not checking to see if the
        file still existed. This caused several plugins to fail to load.
        This has now been corrected [ Bug #3325 ] .

2003-04-25 19:04  richkilmer

        * plugins/rubyide_fox_gui/fxscintilla/util/: Scintilla.iface,
        iface_gen.rb, scintilla_wrapper_gen.rb: no longer needed

2003-04-25 10:30  curthibbs

        * freebase/lib/freebase/readers.rb: If a YAML config file was bad,
        this properties loader simply died and crashed FreeRIDE. In this
        particular instance, the YAML file existed but had a zero length.
        This has now been fixed (i.e. we will ignore bad YAML config files
        and not crash).

        * redist/yaml.rb, redist/log4r.rb, redist/log4r:Log4R removed
        because only a few features were used and Rich wrote a minimal
        replacement for FreeBASE. Yaml.rb is now also part of
        FreeBASE. This is an attempt to make FreeBASE a self contained
        library

        properly.

2003-01-03  ljulliar

        * freebase/configuration.rb, freebase/readers.rb: replaced
        hardcoded "/" with File::SEPARATOR and used File.join to build
        file path. Both are portable across platforms.

2002-12-27 22:36  ljulliar

        * freebase/readers.rb, freebase/properties.rb, freebase/logger.rb,
        freebase/core.rb : YAML property files are now saved/created in
        HOME (Linux) or USERPROFILE (Win32) directory and not in the FR
        directory itself. Nothing should be written in the FR directory.

2002-12-21 16:09  ljulliar

        * config/default.yaml, freeride.rb : version number updated to 0.5.0rc1

2002-12-21 16:06  ljulliar

        * freebase/core.rb : Version number shown in system/properties was
        the FreeBASE version number. Must the FreeRIDE version number.

2002-12-21 16:05  ljulliar

        * freebase/freebase.rb : indent changed for VERSION constant.

2002-12-20 23:05  ljulliar

        * plugins/rubyide_fox_gui/fxscintilla/global_properties.rb : make
        default font size larger on Linux. (It's always smaller than
        Windows). Should probably go in a future yaml file when a
        preference dialog box will allow for font size configuration

2002-12-20 22:47  ljulliar

        * plugins/System_Commands/CoreCommands.rb : Help on Linux must be
        invoked through system (not exec) and open a new Help window.

2002-11-21 14:03  ljulliar

        * doc/userhelp.html : Same version as before but this one was
        written in the RubyIDE Wiki first and then committed in CVS (Do
        not edit this file directly)

2002-11-20 21:54  ljulliar

        * INSTALL, doc/userhelp.html : Installation instructions added to
        the user help file.

2002-11-20 21:18  ljulliar

        * plugins/System_Commands/AppCommands.rb : add help browsing
        command for none windows platform (Assume netscape for now -
        should become a configurable property some day)

2002-11-11 23:51  ljulliar

        * freeride/freeride.rb : forgot the redist prefix in include path

2002-11-11 23:04  ljulliar

        * config/.cvsignore : ignore properties.yaml in CVS

2002-11-11 23:01  ljulliar

        * freeride/freeride.rb : FR architecture specific include path
        appended to the Ruby include path (in preparation of ripper.so
        delivery)

2002-11-10 14:15  ljulliar

        * freebase/plugin.rb: the puts statement uses an erroneous
        variable name

2002-11-10 02:54  richkilmer
  * Yes...its 2:54AM!!!
  * Checked in the major rewite of FreeBASE.  The plugin system is 
  completely rewritten. there is a new configuration.rb file with 
  config classes that manage computing plugin startup and load order/ 
  dependencies/ resolve circular dependencies.  The plugin format is 
  now YAML instead of XML.  The readers.rb file contains the readers 
  for the yaml files.  There is an incomplete reader for reading the 
  XML formats...this will be  completed so we can switch back if 
  needed.  core.rb removes a lot of code that is now managed in the 
  Configuration class.  The plugin.rb file is changed to remove the 
  parsing of XML and instead leverage the PluginConfiguration class 
  to hold config data (all dependency management code is also removed 
  from this class)
  * Added new plugin.yaml files
  * Changed all existing plugin.xml files per new format
  
2002-11-02 13:19  ljulliar

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/fxscintilla/scintilla.rb,
        plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/foxhacks.rb: the 'os_host' config param
        is actually 'host_os'.

2002-11-01 11:15 richkilmer
        * made significant cleanup and code changes.  Added two plugins
        including SourceParser and SourceBrowser.  Fixed debugger (kind
        of).  Fixed UI elements.

2002-10-26 01:00 richkilmer
        * plugins/System_Commands/AppCommands.rb Added command
        'App/File/Load' which is not in the menu but can be called and
        passed a (fully qualified) file path to load.
        
        * plugins/System_GuiCore/ComponentLayout.xml Added View menu
        
        * plugins/System_GuiCore/DockPanes.rb Refactored quite a bit.
        Now, you build docpanes and simply dock them to a (named) docbar
        (with the dock command) instead of having to use the dockbar
        attach method.  The data for a dockpane is used by a renderer...it
        can be whatever the render requires.  In Fox, the is the FX
        component that will be held within the dockpane
        
        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/DockBarRenderFox.rb Minor
        changes...most of the functionality is in DockPane
        
        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/DockPaneRenderFox.rb Major changes.
        Implements the dock and undock commands of its DockPane abstract
        component.  The frame is built by default but not a tab.  The tab
        is constructing if the dockpane is docked to a bar.  This removed
        the need for the faketab hack.  This mechnism now fully
        works...you can create docpanes and dock them to the west and
        south dockbars.
        
        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/foxhacks.rb removed the east dock
        pane (it was causing resize issues.)  tabs are (right now) on the
        top instead of sideways.  I find it hard to read when stuff is
        sideways.
        
        * plugins/DatabusInspector/DatabusInspector.rb remove the close
        button since the x is available in the upper right corner.  added
        the ability to invoke command slots, which can help in debugging
        commands.
        
        * plugins/FileBrowser/* Added file browser plugin which adds
        itself to the View menu and is a simple example of using the
        DockPane.

2002-10-23 11:30  richkilmer
  * plugins/System_Commands/AppCommand.rb
  updated to prevent opening a file twice
  * plugins/System_GuiCore/ComponentLayout.xml
  extended the name of the app
  * plugins/System_GuiCore/EditPanes.rb
  enhaced to make use of the new dialogs and solidified
  the behavior of working with modifed files (save, save as,
  close, etc)
  * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/FoxServices.rb
  added new service commands including:
  App/Services/YesNoCancelDialog: params (title, msg) 
    returns 'yes', 'no', 'cancel'
  App/Services/YesNoDialog: params (title, msg) 
    returns 'yes', 'no'

2002-10-23 09:41  ljulliar

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/FoxServices.rb: @@dir class variable
        must be initialized in the class declaration (Ruby 1.6.6 / Linux)

2002-10-23 1:25 richkilmer
  * plugins/System_Commands/plugin.xml
  added new KeyManager plugin and made AppCommands
  and EditCommands dependant on it.
  * plugins/System_Commands/KeyManager.rb
  added key manager to manage (system wide) the
  mapping of command objects to keys w/modifiers
  * plugins/System_Commands/AppCommands.rb
  updated per new key manager architecture
  * plugins/System_Commands/EditCommands.rb
  updated per new key manager architecture

2002-10-22 12:50 richkilmer
  * plugins/System_GuiCore/EditPane.rb
  changed to standard @component_commands var and fixed open/close
  behavior
  * plugins/System_GuiCore/MenuPane.rb
  created enable/disable(command_path) in menus...not yet enabled in
  fox
  * plugins/System_GuiCore/DockPane.rb
  changed to standard @component_commands var
  * plugins/System_GuiCore/DockBar.rb
  changed to standard @component_commands var
  * plugins/System_GuiCore/Component.rb
  added reference to  @component_commands var

2002-10-21 01:00 richkilmer

  * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/FoxServices.rb
  changed to use the CommandManager to have only one mechanism
  for implementing callable behavior.  The new commands are in
  App/Services/...(FileOpen, FileSaveAs, etc)
  * plugins/System_Commands/AppCommands.rb
  updated per new service calling convention
  * plugins/SYstem_GuiCore/Component.rb
  added reference to @cmd_mgr to all components
  * plugins/System_GuiCore/EditPanes.rb
  updated per new service calling convention

2002-10-17 13:30 richkilmer

  * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/*.rb
  Moved all components under FreeRIDE/FoxRenderer module and 
  renamed all components to the name of the component they are rendering

2002-10-17 01:00 richkilmer

  * plugins/Debugger/plugin.xml
  disabled debugger plugins by setting autoload to 'false'

2002-10-14 11:00 richkilmer

  * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/*.rb
  removed Listener inner classes and connected Fox rendering components
  to new 'pool' component architecture.

2002-10-14 18:00 richkilmer

  * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/DatabusInspectorRenderFox.rb
  removed DatabusInspectorRenderFox.rb and
  moved functionality into DatabusInspector plugin

2002-10-14 00:30 richkilmer

  * plugins/System_GuiCore/NilRenderer.rb
  removed...no longer needed because of new renderer calling
  convention
  
2002-10-14 00:30 richkilmer

  * plugins/System_GuiCore/...
  Major changes to the way components work.  Removed reference to
  the term 'pool' under each component.  Component instances are now
  directly under the component class in /system/ui/components.  Abstracted
  renderer code to be hooked on proc slots under component/commands/???

2002-10-14 00:30 richkilmer

  * freebase/databus.rb
  changed Proc slot to not raise exception if called on a slot
  when the proc has not been set.

2002-10-14 23:18  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/Debugger.rb : the debugger dockpane must also
        be created through the new component manager methods introduced by
        Rich.

2002-10-14 23:12  ljulliar

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/EditPaneRenderFox.rb : edit frame
        introduced by Rich in the previous version broke the close
        method. close now removes the edit frame child instead of the
        scintilla object.

2002-10-13 16:16  richkilmer

        * plugins/System_GuiCore/...
  Removed GuiSetup.xml...replaced by...
  Added ComponentLayout.xml
  Removed GuiSetup.rb...replaced by...
  Added ComponentManager.rb
  Added Component.rb (removed class from GuiSetup.rb)


2002-10-10 03:16  richkilmer

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/*.rb,
  cleaned up how initialization occurs and references to pooling
  
2002-10-10 03:16  richkilmer

        * plugins/System_GuiCore/*.rb,
  The components pools are now managed by a ComponentManager which
  is a new class.  Updated all components to use the new manager in the
  creation of new components.  The manager has add, remove and each 
  methods and optionally accepts a parameter to limit the number of 
  component which solves the hack within the code of AppFrame, etc.
  
2002-10-10 03:16  richkilmer

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/plugin.xml,
  made AppFrameRenderFox dependent on GuiCore
  
2002-10-10 12:50  richkilmer

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/EditPaneRenderFox.rb,
  added a 3d frame around edit controls to enable a raised look within the
  controls

2002-10-8 12:50  richkilmer

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/*.rb
  reformatted to have consistent indentation and removed code that checked
  if something was nil? in an if statement.
  
2002-10-04 15:51  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/Render/Fox/DebuggerRenderFox.rb,
        plugins/Debugger/debuggee.rb, plugins/Debugger/Debugger.rb: start
        implementing the frame and thread selection in the Frame Tab of
        the debugger. Only frame selection works for the moment.

2002-10-01 10:16  ljulliar

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/MenuPaneRenderFox.rb : the slot
        variable doesn't carry the initial slot value because it keeps
        changing in the while loop. The only thing we can display in the
        exception message is the command text.

2002-09-27 02:50  richkilmer

  * GuiSetup.xml: now contains the layout of the appframe/menubar/menupanes/menus
  * GuiSetup.rb: now uses GuiSetup.xml
  * plugin.xml: correctly references the properties file for GuiSetup.rb plugin
  * plugin.xml: removed unused properties file references
  * freebase/properties.rb: added attr_read for base_slot to a properties object        
  * freebase/databus.rb: added new method has_child? to check if a child slot 
  exists w/out creating it.     changed each_slot to sort by name

  * plugins/System_Commands/...: Major overhaul of the way commands work.  
  Added CommandManager plugin and made AppCommands and EditCommands 
  plugin/dependent on it.  The CommandManager is a now the manager of the slot
  "/system/ui/commands" and presents an API for adding, removing and 
  iterating over commands.  CommandBase is no longer needed.  Updated
  AppCommands and EditCommands to reflect the new API.  Each command has its
  own manager object to present an API to the specific command.  Commands are
  now able to be more hierarchical.  Changes Edit and App commands to be under
  App/File... and App/Edit...
  * plugins/System_GUI_Core: Updated to work with new System_Command structure
  Modified MenuPanes' commands= and add_command methods to add the new type
  of command path. Modified GuiSetup to use the new commands= methos and 
  command naming structures and added SEPARATOR for menus.
  * freebase/databus: added ability to recurse child slots with an each_slot
  call. Added notification for when a slot becomes managed :notify_slot_managed
  * DatabusInspector.rb: Changed way that commands are build using command manager
  * Debugger.rb: Changed way that commands are build using command manager
  * AppFrameRenderFox.rb: Changed the reference to the command manager
  * MenuPaneRenderFox.rb: Changed to work with new command structure and added
  ability to insert SEPARATORs in menus.
  * Removed CommandBase.rb and System_Commands.rb

  * freeride/freeride: changed the way freeride is started.  
  Added logic to catch missing properties files.

        * plugins/Debugger/Debugger.rb: Make debugger work on Windows
        platform. Use threads instead of blocking read on a pipe, popen
        instead of popen3.

2002-09-10 16:18  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/debuggee.rb: On Win32 (mswin) redirect STDERR to

2002-09-10 16:14  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/Render/Fox/DebuggerRenderFox.rb: implement 2
        possible ways of redirecting debugged process stdout and stderr to
        FXText console. One is via FOX addInput() and the other one is via
        Ruby threads.  The ruby approach doesn't work on Windows (why??)
        and the FOX approach should work (works for Lyle) but not for me.

2002-09-10 15:36  ljulliar

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/DockPaneRenderFox.rb: end method must

        * plugins/: Debugger/Debugger.rb, Debugger/debuggee.rb,
        System_GuiCore/EditPanes.rb: Breakpoint management revised.
        Brkpoints setting for newly loaded files is now triggered from the
        remote debugger.

2002-08-20 15:32  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/Debugger.rb: Only show the debug line if the
        file is non nil. It can be nil if the debugger is launched on an
        empty file or a file with no ruby statement in it.

2002-08-12 10:44  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/debuggee.rb: Mark DRb threads as hidden and
        don't show them to the end user in the debugging phase. Also catch
        all exit events with the at_exit function. For this to work in all
        cases exit! mut be aliased to exit)

2002-08-09 22:48  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/Debugger.rb: Run to cursor requires a temporary
        breakpoint. Also run_to_cursor does nothing if the current line and
        the target line are the same.

2002-08-09 22:47  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/debuggee.rb: Temporary breakpoint check and
        delete fixed (wrong index argument)

2002-08-09 22:27  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/Debugger.rb: No need to mimic a
        :notify_queue_join on existing slots because breakpoints will be
        set up when file is first loaded in the debugger.

2002-08-09 22:19  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/: Debugger.rb, Render/Fox/DebuggerRenderFox.rb:

        - add/delete breakpoints works ok - debugger icons to drive the
        debugger enabled/disabled depending on the   context - many
        commands functional (step in/out, finish, continue, run to cursor, 
         start/stop, close...)

2002-08-09 17:41  ljulliar

        * plugins/Debugger/debuggee.rb: - redefine exit! as exit to
        intercept all exit events - DRb server subthreads now ignored by

        need full path names

2002-08-09 17:38  ljulliar

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/EditPaneRenderFox.rb: - Icon loader

        markers can be added or deleted in the left margin (shift-click) -
        Markers for breakpoints (red dot) and current line in debugger  
        (yellow background) created.  - Breakpoint marker switch to green
        dot with red perimeter when reached - modified file status now sent
        to edit pane

        * freebase/databus.rb, test/utest_databus.rb: Changed the newly
        added 'hash' slot type to 'map'
        
        Using hash created error for Laurent because slot.hash no longer
        produced the hashcode for the slot (which becomes evident when you
        put a slot into a Hash object.
        
        All methods related to the Hash slot type are now map

2002-08-09 11:43  ljulliar

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/fxscintilla/scintilla_wrapper.rb:
        Several missing functions and constant added. This is a merge with
        the scintilla.rb file from FXRuby. In the future this file should
        be removed and the one coming with FXScintilla.rb or FXRuby used
        instead. But our file has some goodies in it that we must keep for
        the moment.

        Render/Fox/DebuggerRenderFox.rb: Very alpha-- version of the
        debugger plugin. There is no real debugger working behind it. It
        mostly shows how to insert a plugin in a dockbar/dockpane, insert
        anew menu item, run a new command from the menu, build the UI of
        the plugin and hook it to the dockpane. That's not so bad... ;-)

        * freebase/databus.rb: Introduced [] method for Stack and Queue to
        access individual elements (needed by the Databus Inspector).

2002-06-14 16:15  ljulliar

        * freebase/core.rb, plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/foxhacks.rb:
        Conditional hack introduced based on the host OS. If MSWIN then
        apply the hack for the greedy UI thread problem. Otherwise start
        the FOX event loop in a thread as usual. Note: this MSWIN problem
        is being worked on so this is temporary code.

        * ChangeLog, Changelog: Changing change log file name from
        Changelog to ChangeLog

2002-06-03 22:49  pini

        * plugins/System_GuiRenderFox/fxscintilla/scintilla.rb: Corrected
        the microscopic font bug (occured undex Linux).

2002-05-30 17:23  ljulliar

        * test/adapter.rb: All core stuff is now in FreeBASE. Used to be in
        FreeRIDE

2002-05-30 05:48  richkilmer

        * plugins/: System_Commands/AppCommands.rb,
        System_Commands/EditCommands.rb,
        System_Commands/System_Commands.rb, System_GuiCore/AppFrames.rb,
        System_GuiCore/EditPanes.rb, System_GuiCore/GuiSetup.rb,

        System_GuiRenderFox/MenuBarRenderFox.rb,
        System_GuiRenderFox/MenuPaneRenderFox.rb, simpletest/test.rb,
        test1/test.rb: This seems like a major update, but its really
        rather minor.  I created a new module named
        'FreeBASE::StandardPlugin' and now extend each of these (modified)
        plugins with that module to simplify the creation of plugins by
        having default load/start/stop/unload operations.  The plugins now
        (usually) only have to implement 'start'.  This does not change any
        of the behaviors or design that Curt created

2002-05-30 03:59  richkilmer

        * freebase/plugin.rb, freebase/properties.rb,
        plugins/logger/logger.rb, plugins/test2/test.rb: Added
        FreeBASE::StandardPlugin module as mixin to simplify creation of
        plugins, modified logger and test2/test.rb to use new mixin.  Fixed
        bug in properties.rb that arose under linux when reading a slot
        with no value

2002-05-30 03:25  richkilmer

        * plugins/: System_Commands/EditCommands.rb, simpletest/plugin.xml,

2002-05-27 10:46  curthibbs

        * freebase/databus.rb: Added some general debugging code that is
        commented out by default.

2002-05-27 10:44  curthibbs

        * freebase/core.rb: Added a mechanism to tell when all plugins have
        been loaded.

2002-02-27 04:05  richkilmer

        * freebase/: core.rb, plugin.rb: updated to support multiple plugin
        definitions in a single xml file.
        
        Instead of a single <plugin> you specify:
        
        <subsystem>  <plugin...>   ...   </plugin>   <plugin...>    ...  
        </plugin>  </subsystem>

2002-02-26 23:11  curthibbs

        * freebase/core.rb: Clearly identified my FOX workaround as a
        temporary hack.

2002-02-23 14:39  curthibbs

        * freebase/core.rb: Added call to GUI message pump

2002-02-13 05:04  richkilmer

        * config/default.xml, freebase/logger.rb: added the ability to set
        the logging level in the default.xml properties file (0 for all, 6
        for none).  the logger also mounts a proc slot at:
        
        /plugins/Logger/set_level (pass an int 0-6

2002-02-12 04:43  richkilmer

        * freebase/plugin.rb: added the (optional) ability to define a
        resource_path on a plugin.  This resource path can be used for
        locating data files, images, etc needed by the plugin for
        operation.
        
        plugin.xml addition:
        <resourcePath>./plugins/foo/resources</resourcePath>
        
        accessing path: @plugin.resource_path #=> path

2002-02-11 03:39  richkilmer

        * config/default.xml: added log name entry

2002-02-11 03:37  richkilmer

        * plugins/logger/plugin.xml: point to the default (log4r) logger in
        the freebase dir

2002-02-11 03:35  richkilmer

        * freebase/databus.rb: enhanced the exception in the event you try
        and set a manager on a slot that already has one set.

2002-02-11 03:35  richkilmer

        * freebase/logger.rb: moved the logger plugin to freebase (since
        all apps will likely have a need for a logger)

2002-02-08 07:16  richkilmer

        * freebase/databus.rb: added notification type for notifying
        subscribers when a proc is set to a slot:
        
        :notify_proc_set

2002-02-07 04:01  richkilmer

        * freebase/core.rb: Modified the way in which plugin.xml files are
        processed.  The core now also processes ALL .xml files in the
        ./plugins directory in case the behaviors are located somewhere
        else (like under site_ruby).

2002-02-06 04:38  richkilmer

        * config/setup.rb: removed functionality of defining default log
        and shutdown procedure into freebase/core since those are necessary
        databus slots for the core engine.  reserving setup.rb to specific
        needs of a freebase project

2002-02-06 04:35  richkilmer

        * config/default.xml: refactored defining setup file in the
        properties (instead of hard coded)

2002-02-06 04:34  richkilmer

        * freeride/core.rb, freeride/databus.rb, freeride/freeride.rb,
        freeride/plugin.rb, freeride/properties.rb,

        plugins/test1/test.rb, plugins/test2/test.rb, test/databus.rb,
        test/utest_databus.rb: changed for FreeBASE refactoring

2002-02-06 04:33  richkilmer

        * run.bat: changed for freebase and added param for default xml
        property file

2002-02-06 04:24  richkilmer

        * freebase/: core.rb, databus.rb, freebase.rb, plugin.rb,
        properties.rb: moved to freebase from freeride to enable reuse of
        the core (now freebase) in other projects and not just freeride

2002-02-05 05:14  richkilmer

        * config/default.xml, freeride/core.rb: Modified to remove the
        hard-coded dependency of the plugins to be installed int the
        ./plugins directory.  Instead, there is a property
        (config/plugin_path) that contains a concatenated list of
        directories (defaulting to ./plugins) that is iterated upon.  The
        separator for directories in the plugin_path is a semicolon.

2002-02-05 04:27  richkilmer

        slot:
        
        Setting an attriibute slot.attr_<name> = value Getting an attribute
        value = slot.attr_<name>
