This directory is where we store Ruby modules used by FreeRIDE.
We made the decision to have our own copy of the modules because:

- It makes things easier for the FreeRIDE users. FreeRIDE works
  out of the box.

- It eases developer works because we know exactly what module
  version we are working with.

Note to developers:
These modules are managed as vendor branches in CVS. So when you
want to commit a new version of the module refer to the CVS documentation
to import the new module version properly.
